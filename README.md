# FullStack and FrontEnd job interview quick notes

A few days ago, I quit my job; after a weekend of pseudo-leisure, I started -actively- to apply to different vacancies through LinkedIn. I don´t use other services even when I could radically increase my chances. Just "IN" and some nice third-party recruiters. Why am I avoiding popular utilities like *Hired*...?

First, because I do believe that one should create his/her own career (no one better than one knows what one needs): you have to think it, you have to convert those desires of "musts/shoulds" into bullets points and be aware of your requirements. Mine was -mainly- “culture”.
